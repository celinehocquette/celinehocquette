### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Github page!

My name is CÃ©line Hocquette, I am a lecturer at the university of Southampton.

My research focuses on inductive logic programming, which is a form of program synthesis based on logic. In particular, I work on a constraint programming approach to inductive logic programming.

You can explore all my papers on my [website](https://celinehocquette.github.io). My repositories contain the experimental code and data used in my research. Please reach out if you have any questions!
